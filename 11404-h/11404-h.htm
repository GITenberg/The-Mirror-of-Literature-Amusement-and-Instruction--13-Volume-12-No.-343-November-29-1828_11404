    <h3>
      THE ADMIRALTY-OFFICE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <i>Admiralty Office, Whitehall</i>, has few pretensions
      to architectual beauty. It is, however, to use a common
      phrase, a <i>commanding</i> pile, and its association with
      Britain's best bulwarks&mdash;her NAVY&mdash;renders it an
      interesting subject for representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Admiralty-office adjoins to the north side of the Horse
      Guards, and was erected by Ripley, in the reign of George
      II., on the site of Wallingford House. It recedes from, but
      communicates with, the street by advancing wings, and is
      built principally of brick. In the centre of the main
      building is a lofty portico, of the Ionic order, the taste of
      which is not entitled to much praise. It consists of four
      columns, and on the entablature is an anchor in bold relief.
      Here are the offices, and the spacious abodes of the lords
      commissioners of the admiralty, together with a handsome
      hall, &amp;c. On the roof of the building is a Semaphore
      telegraph, which communicates orders by signal to the
      principal ports of the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most tasteful portion of the whole, is a stone
      screen, by Adams, in front of an open court, and facing the
      street. The style is exceedingly chaste and pleasing, and the
      decorations are characteristic naval emblems, finely
      executed. The representation of two ancient vessels in the
      end entablatures, merit especial notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the appointment of the Duke of Clarence to the office
      of lord high admiral, the Admiralty has been the town
      residence of his royal highness. The exterior has been
      repaired, and the interior in part refitted. The screen has
      likewise been renovated with much care, and two of the
      entrances considerably enlarged, but with more regard to
      convenience than good taste. The portion occupied by the
      royal duke contains a splendid suite of state rooms, within
      whose walls have frequently been assembled all the bravery,
      as well as rank, of the empire; for the interests of the
      noble service are too dear to his royal highness to be
      eclipsed by the false lights of wealth or fashion.

    <h3>
      TEMPLE AT ABURY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an inconsistency in the account of Abury in No. 341,
      perhaps overlooked by yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would ask, how could that arrangement of the fabric, so
      fancifully and ingeniously described by Stukely, be intended
      to represent the Trinity, when the place was confessedly in
      existence long anterior to Christianity? nor is there any
      thing in the old Druidical or Bardic tenets that can be
      twisted to any such idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>Abury</i>, with <i>Silbury</i>, is supposed to be the
      <i>Cludair Cyfrangon</i>, or <i>Heaped Mound of
      Congregations</i>, mentioned in the <i>Triads</i>, the
      building of which is recorded as "one of the three mighty
      achievements of the Isle of Britain;" and here were held the
      general assemblies of the Britons on religious occasions, and
      not at Stonehenge, as is generally supposed. This last place
      is decidedly more modern than the pile at <i>Abury</i>; the
      Welsh call it <i>Gwaith Emrys, (the work of Emrys</i>,) and
      it ranks as another of the mighty achievements of the Isle of
      Britain, the third being "the raising of the Stone of Keti,"
      supposed to be the "<i>Maen Ceti</i>" at Gwyr, in
      Glamorganshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presumption that <i>Stonehenge</i> is more modern than
      <i>Abury</i> is founded upon the fact that Stonehenge
      exhibits marks of the chisel in different parts, while the
      former does not. The ancient British documents give us the
      founder of the latter, namely, <i>Emrys</i>, or
      <i>Ambrosius</i>, while we are left in ignorance as to who
      raised the pile of <i>Cyfrangon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Stonehenge ever of such magnitude as <i>Abury</i>,
      the diameter of the former being 99 feet, whilst the latter
      was 1,400; the largest stones of the former weigh 30 tons,
      but the latter weigh 100 tons!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gwaith Emrys</i> was possibly more for political than
      religious assemblies. Here was held the meeting of the
      Britons and Saxons, when the <i>Plot of the Long Knives</i>
      (<i>Twyll y Cyllyll Hirion</i>) was consummated, and the
      flower of the British chiefs treacherously destroyed by their
      pretended friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different authors have strenuously contended
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355"></a>[pg
      355]</span> for giving the honour of supremacy to either of
      these places over both Britain and Gaul, in the days of
      Druidism; but Rowlands has industriously placed its chief
      seat in Anglesey.

    <h3>
      MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The ensuing letter, though very short, discloses one or two
      instances connected with a subject of unfading
      interest&mdash;the death of Mary Queen of Scots. It need
      hardly be stated, says an able writer on this subject, that
      Queen Elizabeth's conduct with respect to the execution of
      Mary was a mixture of unrelenting cruelty, despicable
      cowardice, and flagitious hypocrisy; that whilst it was the
      dearest wish of her heart to deprive her kinswoman of her
      existence, she attempted to remove the odium of the act from
      herself, by endeavouring to induce those to whose custody she
      was intrusted to assassinate their prisoner; that when she
      found she could not succeed, she commanded the warrant to be
      forwarded; and that when she knew it was too late to recall
      it, asserted that she never intended it should be carried
      into execution, threw herself into a paroxysm of affected
      rage and grief, upbraided her counsellors, and first
      imprisoned and then sacrificed the fortunes of her poor
      secretary, Davison, one of her most virtuous servants, as a
      victim to her own fame, and the resentment of the King of
      Scots. These damning facts in the character of Elizabeth are
      too well known to require to be dilated on; they have
      eclipsed the few noble actions of her life, and remain
      indelible spots on her reputation as a woman and a sovereign.
      But we learn from this letter the humiliating effects made by
      her ministers to appease her fury, and her implacable
      resolution to overwhelm the unfortunate Davison with the
      effect of her assumed, or perhaps real repentance. In his
      apology, that statesman informs us, that on the Friday after
      Mary's execution, namely, on the 10th of February, arriving
      at the court he learnt the manner in which the queen had
      expressed herself relative to the event; but being advised to
      "<i>absent himself for a day or two</i>," and being,
      moreover, extremely ill, he left the court, and returned to
      London. Woolley's communication being dated on <i>Sunday</i>,
      (the manuscript is so excessively badly written as to be
      almost illegible,) shows that Elizabeth did not summon her
      council, and evince her displeasure at their conduct, until
      Saturday, the 13th of February, two days after she was
      informed of Mary's fate. Davison had been attacked with a
      stroke of the palsy shortly before, and all he says of his
      committal is, that he was not sent to the Tower until Tuesday
      the 14th, on account of his illness; though some days
      previous (probably on Saturday the 10th) the queen assembled
      her council.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter also exhibits a specimen of Leicester's
      characteristic meanness; for notwithstanding that he was a
      party to the act of forwarding the warrant for Mary's death,
      as his name occurs among those of the council who signed the
      letters to the Earl of Shrewsbury, the earl marshal, and to
      the Earl of Kent, both of which were dated on the 3rd of
      February, 1586-7, commanding them to cause it to be put into
      execution, he took care to withdraw from court before
      Elizabeth performed the roll, which has so justly excited the
      scorn of posterity. It may be also remarked, as another
      example of the official duplicity of the period, that Sir
      Francis Walsingham likewise affected not to have been
      concerned in the affair of dispatching the warrant, as in his
      letter to Lord Thulstone, the secretary to King James, dated
      at Greenwich, on the 4th of March, 1586-7, less than a month
      afterwards, he says, "<i>Being absent from court</i>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356"></a>[pg
      356]</span> when the late execution of the queen, your
      sovereign mother, happened," though we find that he signed
      both the letters just mentioned.

      Among the most attractive scenes of northern Yorkshire is
      Studley Park, renowned for the richness of its sylvan
      scenery, which embosoms the noble ruin of Fountains Abbey.

    <p>
      For the date of my visit to this <i>Arcadia</i>, I must refer
      the reader to that season of life when the pure source of
      thought and feeling is untainted by the world. It is eleven
      miles from my home to Studley Park, five of which I walked in
      the twilight of a summer's evening, and slept at a little
      cottage by the way. The day had been sultry, and the moon
      rose slowly over the mounds of Maiden Bower, once the site of
      the noble mansion of the Percys, now destroyed and
      desolate;<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      and fell in dreary softness on tower and wood, illumining the
      sable firs of Newby Park, and throwing another lustre on the
      gaudy "gowans" that decked the adjacent meadow. Here was a
      scene for the poetic sympathy of youth:
    </p>

          "That time is past,

          Yet not for this faint I, nor mourn;
        </p>

      The morning found me, after an early breakfast, on the road
      to Studley Park. Now there are some "moods of my own mind" in
      which I detest all vehicles of conveyance, when on an
      excursive tour to admire the antique and
      picturesque.&mdash;Thus what numerous attractions are
      presented to us, sauntering along the woody lane on foot,
      which are lost or overlooked in the velocity of a drive! On
      the declivity of a meadow, inviting our reflection, rises a
      little Saxon church, grey with antiquity, and solemnized by
      its surrounding memorials of "Here lies."&mdash;Across the
      heath, encircled with fences of uncouth stones, stands a
      stern record of feudal yore; at the next turn peeps the
      rectory, encircled with old firs, trained fruit trees, and
      affectionate ivy; beneath yon darkened thickets rolls the
      lazy Ure, expanding into laky broadness; and, beyond yon
      western woods, which embower the peaceful hamlet, are seen
      the "everlasting hills," across which the enterprising Romans
      constructed their road. I next passed the boundaries of Newby
      Park, the property of Lord Grantham. Here beneath enormous
      beeches were clustering the timid deer, "in sunshine remote;"
      and the matin songs of birds were sounding from the countless
      clumps <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357"
      name="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span> which skirt this retreat.
      Within that solitude had I enjoyed the society of a brother,
      alas, now no more! and yet the landscape wore the same sunny
      smile as when I carved his name on the towering obelisk
      before him. I felt that sorrow so exquisitely described by
      <i>Burns</i>:

      Leaving Rainton, a sudden rise brings you to the <i>Roman

      Aldborough,<a id="footnotetag3"
      name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
      the Isurium of the Romans, to Inverness, in Scotland. This
      road was repaired by the Empress Heleanae, and hence the
      corruption, from her name, of Learning Lane, its present
      designation. It was laid by the Romans, with stones of
      immense size, which have frequently been dug up. The <i>Via
      Appia</i>, at <i>Rome</i>, which has lasted 1,800 years,
      resembles it in construction. Raised considerably above the
      level of the country which it crosses, it is an object of
      wonder and interest even to the illiterate, on account of the
      continuous perspective it presents; there being no
      <i>bend</i> in it for several miles. Traversing this noble
      monument of art, how are we led to think on the "strange
      mutations" which have overthrown kings and kingdoms in the
      period of its duration, whilst the road remains "like an
      eternity:"

      I reached the ancient town of Ripon as the bells were merrily
      ringing in the towers of its old collegiate minster, for it
      was the anniversary of its patron saint, St. Wilfred. After
      refreshment, and a walk of three miles, I arrived at
      <i>Studley Park</i>. The fairy effect produced on entering
      this beautiful retreat is almost indescribable. We suddenly
      exchange the field and forest scenery for all the poetry of
      prospect. On the right is a declivity clothed with laurel,
      and stretching far away; and on the left a lofty and well
      trimmed fence of laurel, forms a screen or curtain to the
      valley beneath; the sighing of distant woods and the dashing
      of waterfalls, break on the enraptured ear, and cause the
      anxious eye to long for some opening in the verdant shroud.
      Anon the valley is seen; and through an aperture in the
      laurel wall, cut in imitation of a window, breaks as sweet a
      scene as ever <i>Claude</i> immortalized! Unwilling to hazard
      a formal description, I will merely attempt an outline. Far
      below, the silver waters of the <i>Skell</i> meander softly
      amongst statues of tritons, throwing up innumerable fountain
      streams. These are masterly executions after the ancient
      sculptors, and give the scene an air of Grecian classicality.
      Around these triumphs of art, rise lofty woods of graceful
      birch, varied by dark fir, and interspersed with erections of
      Roman and Gothic design. It is in the contemplation of these
      beauties that fancy recalls the mythology of rocky woods,
      peopled with Dryads and Fauns. Passing by a circuitous path
      to the other side of this Eden, by sloping walks shaded with
      ilex, ancient oak, sycamore, cypress, and bay, we have a view
      of the extent of the valley, terminating with the ruins of
      <i>Fountains Abbey</i>, and flanked by rocks, wildly
      overgrown with shrubs; and before us, seen more distinctly,
      are the statues of <i>Hercules</i> and <i>Antaeus</i>, and a
      <i>Dying Gladiator</i>&mdash;the Temple of Piety, in which
      are bronze busts of Titus Vespasian and Nero, and a fine
      bas-relief of the Grecian Daughter. In front of this temple
      the water assumes a variety of fantastical forms, ornamented
      at different points by statues of Neptune, Bacchus, Roman
      Wrestlers, Galatea, &amp;c. The banqueting-house contains a
      Venus de Medicis, and a painting of the Governor of Surat, on
      horseback, in a Turkish habit; on the front of this building
      are spirited figures of Envy, Hatred, and Malice. From the
      octagon tower, Mackershaw Lodge and Wood are seen to great
      advantage; and from the Gothic temple, the dilapidated abbey
      is an object of striking solemnity; whilst an opening
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>[pg
      358]</span> in the distance shows the venerable towers of
      Ripon Minster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wandering eastward, we arrive at the precincts of Fountains
      Abbey, which gradually presents its monastic turrets midway
      in a dell, skirted by hills crowned with trees, and varied by
      rocky slopes to the brook. This abbey was founded in
      consequence of the disgust which certain monks of the
      Benedictine order at St. Mary's, York, had imbibed against
      their <i>relaxed</i> discipline; when struck with the famed
      austerities of the monks of Rievaulx, they left their abode,
      and retired to this valley, under the shade of seven yew
      trees, six of which were (in 1818) standing. The abbey was
      destroyed in the reign of Stephen, and rebuilt in
      1204.<a id="footnotetag4"
      name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
      The present ruin is celebrated for the sublimity of its
      architecture, many parts of which are as perfect as when
      first erected. The tower is 160 feet in height, and is a fine
      specimen of Gothic, in its best taste. It may with safety be
      asserted, that no church or abbey in England can boast of
      such an elegant elevation. The cloisters, 270 feet in length,
      and divided by 19 pillars and 20 arches, extend across the
      rivulet, which is arched over to support them; and near to
      the south end is a large circular stone basin. This almost
      subterranean solitude is dimly lighted by lancet windows,
      which are partially obscured by oaks, beeches, and firs; and
      the gloom is heightened by the brook beneath, which may be
      seen stretching its way through the broken arches. The only
      tomb in the church is that of a cross-legged knight, which
      lies near the grand tower, and represents one of the
      Mowbrays, who died at Ghent, in 1297. Near the altar is a
      stone coffin, in which, according to Dugdale, Lord Henry
      Percy was interred in 1315. Contiguous to the church is an
      extensive quadrangular court, which has been converted into a
      flower garden. On the east side is a line of beautiful
      arches, under one of which is the entrance to the
      chapter-house, a weed-grown solitude of deadly silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="i2">
          "Where the full-voiced choir

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In 1791, by the removal of some fragments of ruin in the
      chapter-house, the sepulchres of several of the abbots were
      discovered; but the inscriptions were obliterated. Over the
      chapter-house were the library and scriptorium. The
      architecture or Fountains Abbey is mixed; in some parts are
      seen the sharp-pointed windows, in others the circular
      arches. The great eastern window is indescribably
      magnificent, being 23 feet in width. There has been a central
      tower, which has long since fallen to decay. The sanctum
      sanctorum is 131 feet in length; over one of its eastern
      windows is the figure of an angel holding a scroll, dated
      1283. The total length of the church is 358 feet. On the
      north side of the quadrangular court is the refectory, which
      was supported by large pillars, and adjoining it is the
      reading gallery, where portions of the Scriptures were
      delivered to the monks whilst at their meals; by the side of
      it are the kitchen and scullery, the former remarkable for
      its spacious arched fire place. Over the refectory was the
      dormitory, which contained 40 cells; and under the crumbling
      steps leading to it is the porter's lodge. Near to the
      refectory are the remains of the abbot's chambers.

      But adieu to the waning glory of Fountains Abbey and the
      receding towers of Ripon Minster, while retracing my path of
      yesterday morning. I must linger awhile on the Roman way,
      where antiquity maintains her supremacy in spite of the war
      of time, and where the earth looks immutable. Now the groves
      of Newby Park re-appear with their "sylvan majesty," creating
      unutterable sympathies; for the wind that bows the
      surrounding branches moves me to weep for that romantic

    <p>
      Paley would employ himself in his Natural Theology, and then
      gather his peas for dinner, very likely gathering some hint
      for his work at the same time. He would converse with his
      classical neighbour, Mr. Yates, or he would reply to his
      invitation that he could not come, for that he was busy
      knitting. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359"
      name="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span> would station himself at
      his garden wall, which overhung the river, and watch the
      progress of a cast-iron bridge in building, asking questions
      of the architect, and carefully examining every pin and screw
      with which it was put together. He would loiter along a
      river, with his angle-rod, musing upon what he supposed to
      pass in the mind of a pike when he bit, and when he refused
      to bite; or he would stand by the sea-side, and speculate
      upon what a young shrimp could mean by jumping in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the handle of his stick in his mouth, he would move
      about his garden in a short hurried step, now stopping to
      contemplate a butterfly, a flower, or a snail, and now
      earnestly engaged in some new arrangement of his flower-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would take from his own table to his study the back-bone
      of a hare, or a fish's head; and he would pull out of his
      pocket, after a walk, a plant or stone to be made tributary
      to an argument. His manuscripts were as motley as his
      occupations; the workshop of a mind ever on the alert;
      evidences mixed up with memorandums for his will; an
      interesting discussion brought to an untimely end by the
      hiring of servants, the letting of fields, sending his boys
      to school, reproving the refractory members of an hospital;
      here a dedication, there one of his children's
      exercises&mdash;in another place a receipt for cheap soup. He
      would amuse his fire side by family anecdotes:&mdash;how one
      of his ancestors (and he was praised as a pattern of
      perseverance) separated two pounds of white and black pepper
      which had been accidentally mixed&mdash;<i>patiens
      pulveris</i>, he might truly have added; and how, when the
      <i>Paley arms</i> were wanted, recourse was had to a family
      tankard which was supposed to bear them, but which he always
      took a malicious pleasure in insisting had been bought at a

      the life of a man far more happily employed than in the

      about going out with Lord Elgin to Constantinople, the very
      headquarters of despotism, we do not perceive, amongst the
      multitude of most characteristic hints and queries which
      Paley addresses to him, a single fling at the Turk, or a

      when the Cossacks would be permitted to erect the standard of

      I will do your visitation for you (Mr. Carlyle was chancellor
      of the diocese,) in case of your absence, with the greatest
      pleasure&mdash;it is neither a difficulty nor a favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observanda&mdash;1. Compare every thing with English and
      Cumberland scenery: e.g., rivers with Eden, groves with
      Corby, mountains with Skiddaw; your sensations of buildings,
      streets, persons, &amp;c. &amp;c.; e.g., whether the Mufti be
      like Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, the Grand Seignior, Mr.
      &mdash;&mdash;.

      2. Give us one day at Constantinople minutely from morning to
      night&mdash;what you do, see, eat, and hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Let us know what the common people have to dinner; get, if
      you can, a peasant's actual dinner and bottle; for instance,
      if you see a man working in the fields, call to him to bring
      the dinner he has with him, and describe it minutely.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      4. The diversions of the common people; whether they seem to
      enjoy their amusements, and be happy, and sport, and laugh;
      farm-houses, or any thing answering to them, and of what
      kind; same of public-houses, roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Their shops; how you get your breeches mended, or things
      done for you, and how (i.e. well or ill done;) whether you
      see the tailor, converse with him, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Get into the inside of a cottage; describe furniture,
      utensils, what you find actually doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the stipulations I make with you for doing your
      visitation is, that you come over to Wearmouth soon after
      your return, for you will be very entertaining between truth
      and lying. I have a notion you will find books, but in great
      confusion as to catalogues, classing, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Describe minutely how you pass one day on ship-board;
      learn to take and apply lunar, or other observations, and how
      the midshipmen, &amp;c, do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. What sort of fish you get, and how dressed. I should think
      your business would be to make yourself master of the middle
      Greek. My compliments to Bonaparte, if you meet with him,
      which I think is very likely. Pick up little articles of
      dress, tools, furniture, especially from low life&mdash;as an
      actual smock, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. What they talk about; company.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Describe your impression upon first seeing things; upon
      catching the first view of Constantinople; the novelties of
      the first day you pass there.

      In all countries and climates, nations and languages, carry

      Geology, or Mineralogy, are very attractive; and in the
      curator's report, we notice that the Museum, previously rich
      in fossil organic remains, has been enriched by numerous
      donations in this department, during the past session. The
      entire number of specimens in the Museum is upwards of 9,000.

      We have not been at Portsmouth for these three years, and
      till we saw this report, were not aware that the State
      Chambers, lately on the Platform Battery, had been pulled
      down towards the close of last year. The building was of some
      interest. It was of stone, with walls of considerable
      thickness, and square vaults below, descending to a level
      with the parade, and used at different periods as dungeons.
      The part on which the vane stood, was erected in the reign of
      Queen Elizabeth, and the other part was built in the time of
      Charles II., whose name, with the date, was on a marble slab
      above the doorway. Of late years the building had been
      modernized and used as a signal-house and subscription
      reading-room. If we are not mistaken, the edifice had often
      been much injured by the encroachments of the sea, and
      probably this led to its removal.

      <i>Conversations on Geology</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      We notice with much pleasure a handsome volume under the
      above popular title, which represents that delightful science
      in the very attractive form of a series of dialogues between
      a mother and her children. The Huttonian and Wernerian
      systems and the Mosaic Geology, are here familiarly
      explained, and illustrative phenomena and recent discoveries
      glanced at in the progress of the conversations. How much
      more profitable are such family recreations than sitting
      hours over spotted pieces of paper, counting the pips of
      dice, or simpering over fashionable novels and tales of
      scandal run mad. Bookish families are usually the happiest,
      at least if we rightly estimate the term. In an early number
      we shall endeavour to find some portion of these
      "Conversations" for our columns.

      This work will appear early in January. It will be on the
      same plan as the volume of last year, and will contain at
      least <i>thirty engravings</i>, on copper and wood. The
      <i>mechanical</i> department is unusually copious, and there
      are some abstracts in the <i>chemical</i>, which are of high

    <p>
      A correspondent of a French work on gardening thinks that
      green turf may be obtained in France by trenching the ground,
      freeing it from stones, covering the surface with two or
      three inches of rich compost, and then laying on the turf.
      The improved soil, he thinks, will retain moisture sufficient
      to keep the turf growing all the summer, and, consequently,
      green.

      <i>Garden of the Hesperides</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      Lieutenant Beachey, in his <i>Travels in Cyrene</i>, recently
      published, has thrown some curious light on the ancient
      account of these celebrated gardens. It appears, that, like
      many other wonders, ancient and modern, when reduced to
      simple truth, they are little more than common occurrences.
      Baron Humboldt and Mr. Bullock have reduced the floating
      gardens of Mexico to mud banks, with ditches between; and
      lieutenant Beachey makes it appear, that the gardens of the
      Hesperides are nothing more than old stone quarries, the
      bottoms of which have been cultivated.

      <i>Preparation of Cinnamon</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The rough bark is first scraped off with knives, and then,
      with a peculiar instrument, the inner rind is stripped off in
      long slips; these are tied up in bundles, and put to dry in
      the sun, and the wood is sold for fuel. The operation was
      thus explained to bishop Heber by the cinnamon peelers; but
      in the regular preparation, the outer bark is not scraped
      off; but the process of fermentation,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>[pg
      361]</span> which the strips undergo when tied up in large
      quantities, removes the coarse parts. The peelers are called

    <p>
      Mr. Mackintosh, contractor for the government works at
      Stonehouse Point, Devon, lately had to descend in the
      diving-bell with workmen to lay the foundation of a sea wall.
      The machine is fitted with convex glasses, in the upper part,
      to serve the purpose of windows; and Mr. Mackintosh states,
      that on several occasions, in clear weather, he has witnessed
      the sun's rays so concentrated by the circular windows, as to
      burn the labourers' clothes, when opposed to the focal point,
      and this when the machine was twenty-five feet under the
      surface of the water!&mdash;<i>From the MS. Journal of the

      By sowing the seed of the wild cowslip in the garden, a
      number of varieties will be produced, some of which have
      flowers of a beautiful bright red colour. May not this
      process be the first step towards the formation of our garden
      polyanthus? if that be not, as is generally supposed, a
      variety of the primrose, rather than of the
      cowslip.&mdash;<i>Gard. Mag</i>.

      <i>French Method of making Coffee</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The principal points are these:&mdash;The
      coffee,&mdash;<i>Turkey or Bourbon</i>,&mdash;should be
      roasted only till it is of a <i>cinnamon colour</i>, and
      closely covered up during the process of roasting. In France
      this is done in closed iron cylinders, turned over a fire by
      a handle, like a grindstone. The coffee should be coarsely
      ground soon after it is roasted, but not until quite cool:
      some think its <i>aroma</i> is better preserved by beating in
      a mortar, but this is tedious. The proportions for <i>making
      coffee</i> are usually <i>one pint of boiling water to two
      and a half ounces of coffee</i>. The coffee being put into
      the water, the coffee-pot should be covered up, and left for
      two hours surrounded with hot cinders, so as to keep up the
      temperature, without making the liquor boil. Occasionally
      stir it, and after two hours' infusion, remove it from the
      fire, and allow it a quarter of an hour to settle, and when
      perfectly clear, decant it. Isinglass, or hartshorn shavings,
      are sometimes used to clarify coffee; but by this addition
      you lose a great portion of its delicious aroma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coffee in England is generally <i>over-roasted</i>, and to
      this fault arise all the inconveniences which are so often
      attributed to coffee, but which, in reality, are produced by
      the imperfect modes of its preparation.&mdash;<i>From the

      <i>Ivy</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      Attached to the officers' barracks at Winchester, is a very
      fine specimen of ivy; its trunk has been severed off to a
      height of more than two feet from the ground, yet it has for
      years continued in healthy vegetation.&mdash;<i>Gard.

      <i>Parasite Sycamore</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      In Kinmel Park, Denbighshire, is an oak tree, which, twenty
      or thirty years ago, lost one of its largest branches by the
      wind, and a partial decay was the consequence; a key from a
      neighbouring sycamore fell into the fracture, which,
      vegetating, has formed for the old mutilated oak a new head.
      This parasite appears to have so completely seated itself,
      that, though the place of its first lodgment is twelve feet
      from the ground, it is thought that its roots will very soon
      penetrate to the earth, and at last destroy its venerable
      nurse.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

      <i>Turpentine</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      Common turpentine is the produce of the Scotch pine. Trees
      with the thickest bark, and which are most exposed to the
      sun, generally yield the most turpentine. The first incision
      is made near the foot of the tree, and as the resin flows
      most abundantly in hot weather, the operations are begun
      about the end of May, and continued to September. The juice
      is received into holes dug in the ground, is afterwards taken
      out with iron ladles, poured into pails, and removed to a
      hollow trunk, capacious enough to hold three or four barrels.
      <i>Essential oil of turpentine</i> is obtained by
      distillation. <i>Common resin</i> is the residuum of the
      process for obtaining the essential oil. <i>Tar</i> is
      obtained from the roots and other parts of old trees. <i>Med.

      <i>Gum Arabic</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      The purest and finest gum arabic is brought in caravans to
      Cairo, by the Arabs of the country round Mounts Tor and
      Sinai, who bring it from this distance on the backs of
      camels, sown up in bags, and often adulterated with sand,
      &amp;c. The gum exudes spontaneously from the bark and trunk
      of the branches of the tree, in a soft, nearly fluid state,
      and hardens by exposure to the air, or heat of the sun. It
      begins to flow in December, immediately after the rainy
      season, near the flowering time of the tree. Afterwards, as
      the weather becomes hotter, incisions are made through the
      bark, to assist the transudation of the
      juice.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

      As I intend to write the following pages entirely for my own
      amusement, and as they will most probably never meet the eye
      of mortal man, who alone can decipher them, it is unnecessary
      for me to make any observations on the doctrine of
      metempsychosis, to which indeed my reader (if there shall
      ever be one) may perhaps not be inclined to give implicit
      belief. It is unnecessary for me, therefore, to begin by
      alluding to my former visit to this earth. I shall not even
      hint, whether if it ever took place, it was in antediluvian
      ages, or during the Babylonian, Grecian, or Roman glory; or
      in more modern times. Be assured, however, gentle reader, (if
      any there ever be,) that I have the faculty of
      observation&mdash;that I have seen many generations of
      men&mdash;that I have been in almost every corner of the
      habitable world, and that I am intimately acquainted with the
      history of mankind.&mdash;(Sir Walter Scott's Novels I have
      listened to with the greatest attention!)&mdash;I have eat
      opium in Constantinople&mdash;garlic in Italy&mdash;potatoes
      in Ireland. I have dabbled my whiskers in Guava
      jelly&mdash;have drunk rack at Delhi, and at New South Wales
      I have enjoyed the luxuries of Kangaroo soup and Opossum
      gravy. I have been at the Highland-moors with young
      Englishmen&mdash;at Melton with young Scotsmen, and at
      bathing-quarters with old dowagers and their daughters. I
      have travelled in all ways&mdash;by seas&mdash;by
      land&mdash;on foot&mdash;on horseback&mdash;in a
      carriage&mdash;in a ship&mdash;in a palanquin&mdash;in a
      muff; but the motion of the camel I never could bear, it so
      jolted my poor old bones, and discomposed my whole body.
      India never agreed well with me. The insects, not to mention
      the serpents, annoyed me. The heat made me quite bilious;
      and, indeed, I began to feel my liver affected. And however
      partial I naturally was to perfumes, I soon had a great
      dislike to the strong smell of musk, which I felt about
      myself, and which, as I observe every historian agrees, very
      soon begins to appear in all of my species who reside for any
      time in India. Musk should not of itself be disagreeable; but
      to have it constantly below one's nose, and to have every
      thing you touch smelling of it, you may easily conceive must
      be very annoying.

      The Count de Buffon, whom we reckon one of our best
      historians, I see, says we are an omnivorous animal, and that
      we only seem to prefer hard substances to those which are
      tender or succulent. In this, however, he is mistaken; at
      least I can answer for myself. I know, for my part, I prefer
      mulligatawney and a tender young chicken, to an old pair of
      boots or a well-picked bone.

      I have the misfortune, my reader, whoever you may be, to
      belong to a race to which you have an aversion; I may say a
      perfect horror. I am a wretched proscribed animal. A lady
      would faint at the sight of me; and if I should merely run
      across a room, a whole legion of boys and footmen would be
      after me; and if they should kill me, they themselves, and I
      am afraid every other person, would give them credit for
      doing a meritorious action. But, gentle reader, our character
      is worse than it should be. Although we never received any
      kindness from man, I am sure I can answer for myself, at
      least, I have not very often done him mischief for mischief's
      sake; and do remember that I did not choose my own form, and
      that perhaps I am now doomed to animate it from the contempt
      and cruelty, with which, in better days, I may have used the
      species. But I moralize, and this does not well suit my
      present condition. You may think it as ridiculous an idea as
      an oyster in love, which, I remember, used to tickle my
      fancy. I must only for one moment be allowed to observe, that
      man bestows far too much care and attention on that
      green-eyed monster, which I do detest&mdash;I mean the cat.
      If we were caressed and made much of like it, and half so
      carefully attended to, I am sure we would make a much better
      return, and be truly grateful and attached. My friend Buffon
      seems perfectly to understand their character, and I must be
      allowed to quote a sentence or two from him, which I know
      will be much more credited than any thing I could myself say.
      "They possess," says he, "an innate malice, and perverse
      disposition, which increase as they grow up, and which
      education teaches them to conceal, but not to subdue. From
      determined robbers, the best education can only convert them
      into flattering <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363"
      name="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span> thieves, for they have
      address, subtlety, and desire of plunder." ... "They easily
      assume the habits of society, but never acquire its manners,
      for they have only the appearance of attachment and
      friendship." And again he says, "the cat appears to have no
      feelings which are not interested&mdash;to have no affection
      which is not conditional&mdash; and to carry on no
      intercourse with man, but with the view of turning it to his
      own advantage. Even the tamest are under no subjection, for
      they act merely to please themselves."

      The dog is a very different animal. He is really attached to
      his master, and only lives to serve him. A dog is a perfect
      gentleman, and I love to fight with gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apostle Paul, in his Epistle to the Philippians,
      says,&mdash;"Beware of dogs!" c. iii. v. 2. Now, I cannot
      help always having thought, that he must have meant cats. It
      is very easy to suppose the Greek word
      "&kappa;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;" "[Greek: kunas]," may
      have crept in instead of
      "&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;" "[Greek: galas]" and
      this, indeed, is I believe, corroborated by the folio
      manuscript copy of the Bible, of 1223, in the British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our race is generally said to have come from some of the
      islands in the Levant, or according to others, from Sweden;
      but I can ascertain with certainty, that my family came to
      France along with the Huns, and that my immediate ancestors
      came over to England with William the Conqueror, in 1066. I
      consider my blood, therefore, as purely British as any of the
      inhabitants of the island. There is a tradition among us,
      that the descendants of the pair who cruised with old Noah,
      settled in the north of Asia, and that we were to be found no
      where else for about 500 years afterwards. As to this,
      however, I do not pretend to speak with certainty; but one
      thing I know, that wherever man is seen to inhabit, we are to
      be found&mdash;wherever he goes, we attend him. We sent out
      parties to make discoveries with Vasquez de Gama, Dampier,
      Anson, and Cook, and although we English gentlemen (who have
      no blood-relationship with the Norwegians) are known to have
      such a natural abhorrence at cold, the love of science
      prevailed, and a strong party were sent to the frozen seas
      with Ross, Lyon, and Parry. Pontoppidan sagely observes, that
      "neither the wood nor water R*ts can live farther north than
      Norway; that there are several districts, as that of
      Hordenvor, in the diocese of Bergen, and others in the
      diocese of Aggerhum, where no R*ts are to be found; and that
      the R*ts on the south banks of the Vormen soon perish, when
      carried to the north side of it." But we do not reckon Mr.
      Pontoppidan a historian implicitly to be believed, and indeed
      the Admiralty took such care of us, that we might have
      remained for years at the Pole itself, without even having
      the toothache!

      We always accompany the first visiters of countries, and when
      they take possession for their king, we do so for ourselves;
      and without being put to much trouble in carrying out stores,
      we have always the best and the pick of every thing. Often
      have I laughed at the pains man took to preserve his property
      from man. Stone and iron are made to do their best-armed
      sentries walking night and day&mdash;when all the time I
      have, with the coolest composure, been daily wallowing in the
      best of every thing. Nature abhors a vacuum, and will not
      allow us to starve, especially in the midst of plenty; but I
      may safely say, that I never wantonly destroyed, and, if
      possible, have always preferred the rich man's store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the flood, as the cave of Yorkshire no doubt proves,
      we were to be found in this island&mdash;but upon this
      subject I shall not enter at present. Probably what is now
      Britain, was not then an island&mdash;I leave this, however,
      to wiser heads!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of the year &mdash;&mdash;, my parents
      accompanied the baggage of the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoon Guards
      to Scotland. They told me they came in the carts with the
      sergeants' wives, as being the most comfortable. I was born
      above one of the stables on the east side of the court of
      Piershill barracks, or as I used to hear the soldiers then
      call it, "Jock's Lodge," which is within a mile and a half of
      Edinburgh. My father was a kind, sensible gentleman, and was
      much esteemed by all his friends; and I sincerely forgive him
      for the great desire, and the many attempts he made to eat me
      up. It was a natural instinct, and poor fellow, he could not
      be blamed for it. If he had succeeded, it would have saved me
      many vexations and trials, but my poor mother thought
      otherwise; and I am sure she fought most valiantly with my
      father whenever he made any attempt of the kind.

      [He might, perhaps, have lived and died in the barracks where
      he was born, had it not been for his miraculous escape from a
      <i>hunt</i> by the officers of the dragoons. A few nights
      afterwards a large band of R*ts made an excursion of several
      miles, and in returning, remained for a day or two at Leith.

      We set sail in a few days with a fair wind down the Frith,
      and soon left the Bass and the May behind us. I must confess,
      I was a little afraid, when, for the first time, I was out of
      sight of land. It is a dismal thought to have nothing but sea
      and sky around, and only a frail plank between us and the
      fathomless depths of ocean. This was my first voyage; but
      many a day and month and year have I spent on the water since
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a little squeamish or so for the first day, but nothing
      like some of our passengers. The great secret I have always
      found, is to eat plenty, and drink a little brandy; that is
      much better than all your quack receipts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a dog on board, but he was a lazy, mangy fellow, and
      gave us little trouble. The wind continued favourable, and on
      the sixth evening, the lights of Goeree and Helvoetsluis were
      visible. Some of the passengers left us at the latter town;
      but I merely went ashore and took a rapid look of the
      streets, and of the guard-ship, which was in the Dock in the
      centre of the town, and returned to the smack by the
      captain's boat. I saw rather a curious scene on board the
      man-of-war. Some of her men had been engaged in a row the
      previous night, and were sentenced to be flogged. After being
      stripped, they seemed to dip each man in the water before
      commencing the more disagreeable part of the operation. If I
      had not been in such a hurry, I should certainly have made
      bold to have carried a biscuit to a poor little midshipman,
      who was condemned to remain twelve hours at the mast-head for
      some nonsense or other, and who looked most miserably cold.

      Mynheer is certainly a strange fat-bottomed animal after all.
      His pipe never seems to be out of his mouth, nor his hands
      out of his pockets. The pilots who came on board, with their
      very little hats, their immense wide, short breeches, and
      large wooden shoes, surprised me not a little. The Dutch get
      the credit of being very cleanly, but I cannot say much as to
      that, in their persons at least. The Bad Huis, or Bath Hotel,
      which is on the Boom Keys, the best street in Rotterdam, was
      recommended to me as the only one a gentleman could go to,
      and there accordingly I and four of the passengers took up
      our quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole, there did not appear much to be seen in the
      town. The inhabitants seemed more an eating and drinking sort
      of people than any thing else. Their ferries through the town
      are a very great nuisance, as one cannot always have a doit
      about them; and a surly, brown, Dutch rascal at one time had
      the impudence to stop me till I had to borrow from a friend.
      The statue of Erasmus is a shabby concern.

    <p>
      A party were intending, I found, to make a trip along the
      Rhine; so I thought I could not do better than join them. We
      went by the Hague, Haarlem, and Amsterdam. With the last, I
      was much disappointed. They say it contains 200,000 human
      inhabitants, but it has not even a tolerable hotel. The
      famous Haarlem tulip gardens, I of course visited,
      particularly those of Van Eeden. I wonder what the fools
      could see in tulips, who gave 10,000 guilders for one root.
      The organ is certainly very fine; but it nearly cracked the
      drum of my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at Amsterdam, I was nearly carried off to Archangel,
      which would, at the time, have been rather a bore indeed.
      After a grand let-off, given by a rich burgo-master, to which
      my friends got me a special invitation, I incautiously
      exceeded in the cura&ccedil;oa, of which I did not at all
      then know the strength. The vessel put to sea, and I had
      enough to do to secure my retreat in the pilot boat. From
      Amsterdam we proceeded in a curious, large diligence to
      Utrecht, and from that to Cologne. We had twelve (human)
      passengers inside, who smoked the whole time without
      intermission. I, as well as all my species, are most partial
      to perfumes, and I did not therefore fail to visit the
      representative of Signior Jean Marie Farina in his shop, No.
      4568, &agrave; la rue haute &agrave; Cologne. Nothing struck
      me particularly in this town of Cologne. The streets are very
      narrow, and seemed dull enough. To be sure, the principal
      one, which is said to be a German league in length, is rather
      fine. The old convent of the Ladies of St. Ursula, is curious
      at least. They show you in it the bones of 11,000 virgins,
      who they say were murdered by the Huns at the time of their
      invasion, when they destroyed the town. I might easily have
      had a taste of them; but I had no fancy for such antiquated
      old maids. In the Cathedral, or Dom, as they call it, you see
      the tomb of the three famous kings of Cologne, and the gold
      and silver chests which contain the bones of the Holy
      Engelberth. I don't think, in the whole town, there is any
      thing else worth the trouble of looking at. The hotel "Le
      Prince Charles," I found tolerably comfortable:
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365"></a>[pg

      fellow.

    <h3>
      FAGGING AT WINCHESTER SCHOOL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following outline of a recent quarrel at Winchester
      School serves to illustrate the <i>System</i> of
      <i>Fagging</i> as practised at one of our leading schools,
      among the "future clergy, lawyers, legislators, and peers of
      England." It is extracted from a pamphlet by Sir Alexander
      Malet, Bart.; and we hope this <i>expose</i> will lead to the
      extermination of the "custom:"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The prefects, or eight senior boys of the school, are in the
      habit of fagging the juniors; and that they may have a
      greater command of their services during meal times, they
      appoint one of the junior boys with the title of course
      keeper, whose business it is to take care that whilst the
      prefects are at breakfast or supper, the juniors sit upon a
      certain cross bench at the top of the hall, that they may be
      forthcoming whenever a prefect requires any thing to be done.
      During that part of the short half-year in which there are no
      fires kept, a sufficient number of boys for this service was
      generally furnished from the fourth class, and it was
      considered that the junior part of the fifth class, which is
      next in the ascending scale, was exempt from so disagreeable
      a servitude. It appears, however, that within these few
      years, there has been a much greater press of boys to enter
      the school than formerly; the consequence has been, that they
      have come to it older and more advanced in their studies than
      formerly, and the upper departments of the school have
      received a greater accession of numbers in proportion than
      the lower classes. The fourth class, therefore, gradually
      furnishing a smaller number of fags, the prefects issued a
      mandate, that the junior part of the fifth class should share
      with the fourth in the duty of going on hall: this was for
      some time submitted to; but at length one of the boys of this
      class intentionally abstained from seating himself on the
      cross bench at supper-time, and being seen by the senior
      prefect, and desired by him to go on hall, refused to do so,
      and argued the point as a matter of right, alleging, as the
      ancient usage of the school, the exemption of the junior part
      of the fifth class from this duty till the commencement of
      fires; he referred to the course keeper as being the
      depositary of the rules, and expressed himself prepared to
      abide by his decision. The course keeper, who does not appear
      to have been very well versed in the usages of the school,
      decided that the boy ought to go on hall; and the prefect
      therefore resolved, not only to enforce this new rule, but to
      punish the contumely of this unlucky boy by giving him a
      public chastisement. To this, however, the junior did not
      feel inclined to submit, and a second prefect laid hold of
      him, that he might not evade the beating destined for him: a
      simultaneous movement then took place amongst the juniors,
      who pinioned the two prefects, released the boy who was being
      beaten, and gave them to understand that the intended
      chastisement should not be inflicted. The prefects instantly
      laid a complaint before the head master, who expelled the boy
      who had refused to go on hall, and five others, who had
      appeared most active in preventing the prefect from punishing
      him.

      THE SUICIDE LOVER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A young man, of rich and respectable parents, was for a long
      time passionately in love with a young lady of the same town,
      whose birth and fortune were equal to his own; he had also
      the good fortune not to displease the young lady. Both
      families were anxious to bring the business to a conclusion;
      notwithstanding which the intended always found some specious
      pretext to put off the ceremony. The parents of the lady,
      after yielding for some time to the different excuses of
      their future son-in-law, as they could not find out the
      motive, began to be weary of being put off so often, and at
      last declared to him that a rival, who was his equal in every
      thing, had presented himself, and that if he did not soon
      make up his mind, they should be obliged to give up to the
      desire of his rival. The young man upon this information made
      up his mind; and, after the necessary arrangements, the day
      for the ceremony arrived. The bride, the two families and
      friends, were assembled, and waited only for the bridegroom
      in order to proceed to church, when a servant arrived with
      the sad intelligence that his master was taken suddenly ill,
      and in consequence requested that the celebration of the
      nuptials might once more be deferred for a few days. Two of
      his friends, who witnessed both the surprise and even the
      indignation which was marked on every countenance, left the
      party, and hastened to the gentleman's house, and pointed out
      in such strong colours the folly, as well as the bad
      consequences of his behaviour, that he sent them away,
      assuring them that he would dress himself and follow them
      immediately. But an hour having elapsed, and no bridegroom
      appearing, the two friends again set out to inquire into the
      cause of the delay, which seemed to them more than ever
      extraordinary. They had just arrived at the foot of his
      staircase, when they heard the report of a pistol. They
      hastened to ascend, and having forced open the door of the
      young man's apartment, they found him dead upon the floor,
      weltering in his blood. They were so shocked at the sight
      before them, that they could not return to announce the fatal
      news, but instantly dispatched a servant for that purpose. It
      is more easy to conceive than describe the consternation such
      a piece of intelligence was likely to throw every one into;
      but the situation of the bride was most to be pitied; she not
      only lost a lover just on the point of being her husband, but
      fancied that he had received some calumnious information
      which caused him to prefer death to the necessity of being
      united to her. It was some days before this mystery was
      cleared up, as it was not until the seals were broken, that
      they found the following written paper in his desk, dated
      eight days before the fatal catastrophe:&mdash;"I adore
      Mademoiselle de N&mdash;&mdash;, and shall do so all my life.
      Her virtues surpassed if possible her charms; and I would
      sacrifice the last drop of my blood rather than cause her the
      least uneasiness. But the cruel and dangerous passion of
      jealousy possesses me to such a degree, that notwithstanding
      all her merits, the bare idea of a rival makes me wretched.
      Every effort on my part, joined to the voice of reason, has
      never been able to eradicate this dreadful poison from my
      heart, and which I fear is incurable. If I yield to my
      penchant for her, and become her husband, instead of being a
      tender lover, of which she is so worthy, I should be a
      tyrant, whose frenzy would render her more miserable than
      myself. They press me to bring our union to a conclusion,
      they threaten me also with a rival, who without doubt
      deserves her more than I. How can I, miserable wretch that I
      am, how can I ward off the blow which threatens me? I flatter
      myself, at least, to have succeeded in my endeavours to
      conceal the vice of a heart which, although entirely her own,
      can never exterminate the miserable passion which possesses
      it. The time approaches with rapid strides when I must make
      up my mind. Good Heaven direct me! shall I risk making her
      unhappy? Can I resolve to see her the wife of another? Never,
      no never! rather let me die a hundred deaths...."
    </p>
    <p>
      This unfortunate youth had written no more, but it was
      sufficient to prove that he had sacrificed himself for the
      happiness of his mistress.

      FILTHY WATER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the unhappy victims of mud-juice had constant access to
      the solar microscope, and there was occasionally in London a
      little sunshine to set off the animated bedevilments which
      are crowded into the composition, and could see thousands of
      animals, generated in filth, and living in the highest
      spirits and the greatest abundance, in the stuff destined for
      their stomachs, they would go mad. Boiled down in tea (for
      which, in the midst of <i>starvation</i>, a cockney pays five
      hundred per cent. beyond its value, and a tax of five hundred
      per cent. more than that,) these centipedes, toads, small
      alligators, large worms, white bait, snails, caterpillars,
      maggots, eels, minnows, weeds, moss, offal in detachments,
      gas-juice, vinegar lees, tallow droppings, galls, particles
      of dead men, women, children, horses, and dogs, train-oil,
      copper, dye-stuff, soot, and dead fish, are all, according to
      the chemistry of the washerwomen, neutralized, mollified,
      clarified, and rectified&mdash;but this we doubt; and if any
      of the unhappy persons who imbibe nastiness fourteen times a
      week, under the idea that it is good and wholesome because it
      is hot, will take the trouble to look at the agreeable
      deposit in the bottom of the "slop-basin," they will find
      that independent of all the muddy, fishy, oily, gaseous,
      animal and vegetable stuff, introduced into their stomachs
      under the guise of that most poisonous of all herbs, tea,
      they are in the habit of swallowing mud, earth, stones, sand,
      and gravel, in quantities sufficient to establish in less
      than three months spaces of land as big as Cornish freeholds
      in their insides.&mdash;<i>John Bull</i>.

      NAPOLEON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      While Napoleon was a subaltern in the army, a Russian officer
      remarked, with much self-sufficiency, "That his country
      fought for glory and the French for gain."&mdash;"You are
      perfectly right," answered Napoleon; "every one fights for
      that which he does not possess."

      FORBIDDEN FRUIT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sir Richard Steele, who represented the borough of
      Stockbridge, Hants, in parliament in the reign of Queen Anne,
      carried his election against a powerful opposition, by
      sticking a large apple full
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368"></a>[pg
      368]</span> of guineas, and declaring that it should be the
      prize of that man whose wife was first brought to bed after
      that day nine months. This merry offer procured him the
      interest of the ladies, who, it is said, commemorate Sir
      Richard's bounty to this day, and once made a vigorous effort
      to procure a standing order of the corporation, that no man
      should ever be received as a candidate who did not offer
      himself on the same terms.

      CONVENIENT ABSENCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An individual often visited a landscape painter, who had a
      very beautiful wife, but he always met with the husband.
      "Zounds," said he, one day to him, "for a painter of
      landscapes, you are very seldom in the country."

      TARRAGON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We recommend our correspondent, <i>Qy?</i> to steep shalots
      and tarragon in vinegar, to be used as a sauce with
      rump-steaks. Or he may chop the shalots and tarragon <i>very
      fine</i>, and sprinkle them over the meat. Tarragon sprinkled
      over mutton chops is a nice relish; and with <i>sauce
      piquante</i> flavoured with the above vinegar, makes a dish
      on "which the gods might dine."

      PEREMPTORY CONCLUSION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      An advocate, whose pleading appeared too diffuse for the
      cause he was defending, had received an order from the first
      president to abridge it; but the former, without omitting a
      word of his intended address, replied in a firm tone, that
      all he uttered was essential. The president, hoping at length
      to make him silent, said to him, "The court orders you to
      <i>conclude</i>." "Well," replied the advocate, "then I
      <i>conclude</i> that the court shall hear me."

    <h3>
      GROUNDS OF RECOGNITION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A man went to a restaurateur's (or chop-house) in France, to
      dine. He perceived another man in the room and hurried away
      to tell the master. "If you do not, Sir, order that man, who
      is dining alone at the table in the corner, out of your
      house, a respectable individual will not be able to sit down
      in it."&mdash;"How is that, Sir?"&mdash;"Because that is the
      executioner of R&mdash;&mdash;." The host, after some
      hesitation, at length went and spoke to the stranger, who
      calmly answered him: "By whom have I been
      recognised?"&mdash;"By that gentleman," said the landlord,
      pointing out the former. "Indeed, he ought to know me, for it
      is not two years since I whipped and branded him."

    <h3>
      SINGULAR MISTAKE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A courtier was playing at piquet, and was greatly annoyed by
      a short-sighted man with a long nose. To get rid of it he
      took his pocket handkerchief and wiped his troublesome
      neighbour's nose. "Ah, sir," said he immediately, "I really
      beg your pardon, I took it for my own."

    <h3>
      BROTHERS AND SISTERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the revolution, a young man was travelling in the
      Diligence to Lyons with "<i>a brother and a friend</i>," when
      they had got about half way the latter's purse became empty;
      "<i>Brother</i>," said he to the young man, "pay for me, and
      I will return it to you at Lyons." "I cannot."&mdash;"Why,
      are we not brothers?" "Oh certainly, but <i>our purses are

        Here Henry Percy, the fourth Earl of Northumberland, was
        murdered by an infuriated mob, in the fourth year of Henry
        VII.; he having, as lord lieutenant of the county, levied a
        tax on the people by order of his sovereign, for carrying
        on the war in Bretague. Skelton, poet-laureat to Henry
        VIII. lamented his death in some elegiac lines.

        Aldburgh, or Aldborough, so called by the Normans, was the
        Iseur of the Ancient Britons, and the Isurium of the
        Romans. Perhaps there is not another Roman city, not even
        excepting York, where so many antiquities have been
        discovered. The opening of ancient baths, burial vaults,
        &amp;c. has led to the finding of tesselated pavements,
        coins, urns, rings, lachrymatories, seals, monumental
        inscriptions, medals, statues, chains, sacrificing vessels,
        &amp;c. It is to be lamented that modern ignorance and
        barbarity are fast obliterating all traces of the Roman
        walls of Isurium; their foundations having been dug up for
        the mercenary purpose of obtaining their materials. We
        cannot sufficiently censure such irreverence to "hoar
        antiquity," or the contracted and grovelling ideas which
        actuate such village Vandals.

        six days before our coming, he committed theft and
        sacrilege, confessing the same; for at midnight he caused
        the chapleyne to stele the keys of the secton, and took out
        a jewel, a cross of gold with stones; one <i>Warren</i>, a
        goldsmith of the Chepe, was with him in his chamber at the
        hour, and there they stole out a great emerode with a
        rubye, the said <i>Warren</i> made the Abbot believe the
        rubye was a garnet, and so for that he paid nothing for the
        emerode, but &pound;20. He sold him also plate, without
        weight or ounces.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
